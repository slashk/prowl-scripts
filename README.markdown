  transmission: if you use transmission, you know that you can set a
"completed-script" that runs once a bit torrent download has finished. I
use this script to send myself a prowl with the torrent that has
finished.

  google-adsense: to keep tabs on my blogging empire, I have this script
run out of crontab twice a day. It sends you a prowl with your daily and
monthly earnings.

  woot: if you hate to miss a valuable gadget on woot (or wine woot, or
sellout woot), you should set this up in crontab to run every fifteen
minutes or so. It will prowl you whenever a particular woot site changes
items.
